Description: An R package designed to assist in the process of agricultural
    yield data cleaning. It has been designed to automate the identification
    and removal of common erroneous yield data. cydr implements previously
    developed algorithms in R, a language widely used by both agricultural
    researchers and data analysts. Additionally, cydr extends upon previous
    research by providing functionality to remove erroneous data associated
    with canola, a largely ignored category of datasets. By using predefined
    defaults and optional parameters, cydr ensures accessibility for new
    users, while providing powerful functionality for experienced users.
